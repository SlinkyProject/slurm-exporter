## Overview

Slurm metrics are collected from Slurm through the
[Slurm REST API][slurm-restapi] and exported as Prometheus types. The exporter
is granted authorization via an authentication JWT token, hence it runs with
privileges of a Slurm cluster user via token.

The recommended deployment mechanism is through [Helm] chart.

## Features

### Nodes

- [**Allocated**][node-allocated]: nodes which have been allocated to one or
  more jobs.
- [**Completing**][node-completing]: all jobs associated with this node are in
  the process of COMPLETING.
- [**Down**][node-down]: nodes which are unavailable for use.
- [**Drain**][node-drain]: nodes which are marked as drain, unavailable for
  future work but can complete their current work.
  - [**Drained**][node-drained]: nodes which are unavailable for use (per system
    administrator request) and have no more work to complete.
  - [**Draining**][node-draining]: The node is currently allocated to job(s),
    but will not be allocated additional jobs.
- [**Idle**][node-idle]: nodes which are not allocated to any jobs and is
  available for use.
- [**Maintenance**][node-maint]: nodes which are currently in a *maintenance*
  reservation.
- [**Mixed**][node-mixed]: nodes which have some but not all of their CPUs
  ALLOCATED, or suspended jobs have TRES (e.g. Memory) still allocated.
- [**Reserved**][node-reserved]: nodes which are in an advanced reservation and
  not generally available.

### Partitions

- **Nodes**: number of nodes associated with the partition.
- **CPUs**: number of CPUs associated with the partition.
- **Jobs**: number of incomplete (e.g. pending, running) jobs in the partition.
- **Allocated CPUs**: number of ALLOCATED CPUs among all nodes in the partition.
- **Idle CPUs**: number of IDLE CPUs among all nodes in the partition.
- **Pending Jobs**: number of pending jobs in the partition.
- **Pending Jobs, Max Nodes**: max number of nodes requested among all pending
  jobs in the partition.
- **Running Jobs**: number of running jobs in the partition.
- **Held Jobs**: number of held jobs in the partition.

### User Statistics

- **Job Count**: number of incomplete (e.g. pending, running) jobs for the user.
- [**Pending Jobs**][job-states]: number of pending jobs for the user.
- [**Running Jobs**][job-states]: number of running jobs for the user.
- [**Held Jobs**][job-states]: number of held jobs for the user.

## Limitations

Currently only a minimal set of metrics are collected. More metrics may be added
in the future.

- **Slurm Version**: >=
  [24.05](https://www.schedmd.com/slurm-version-24-05-0-is-now-available/)

## Installation

Install `kube-prometheus-stack` for metrics collection and observation.
Prometheus is also used as an extension API server so custom Slurm metrics may
be used with autoscaling.

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace=prometheus --create-namespace
```

Install the slurm-exporter:

```bash
helm install slurm-exporter oci://ghcr.io/slinkyproject/charts/slurm-exporter \
  --namespace=slurm-exporter --create-namespace
```
